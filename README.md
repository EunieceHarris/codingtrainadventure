<h1>Valkömmen till Eureka Biblioteket</h1>

<b>Welcome to the Eureka Library - here on GitHub.</b>

For my senior project, I wanted to dive into the world of web development and create a site that is an expression of my journey. The site (eureka.eunieceharris.com) is designed to resemble the Dalarna Media Library (Dalarna Högskola). 

What may appear as blocks are modelled after the shelves of the <a hreff="https://www.adept.dk/project/dma-library" target="_blank">Dalarna Media library</a>. Some shelves have links some links have content. This is an ode to the library's many empty shelves that anticipate content. In the same spirit, my library is an ongoing collection of all things web development. The primary content displays the most recent thing I've accomplished with the bottom of the page displaying information about the work, my goal, and other kinds of content such as a collection of objects (saker), words (ordlista), a photo exhibition, and more.

You'll also notice that the site is written primarily in Swedish. In addition to learning different programming languages, I've been learning the Swedish language as well and wanted to incorporate it into the site as well.

The site is ever-changing so one week it may have one shelf then the next it's not. I imagine during this journey, once I learn methods in maintaining a website, both on the front-end and back-end, redundant tasks will be accmplished dynamically. What the site might look like then, I can only imagine...
