<h1>Project: Eureka Biblioteket</h1>

Welcome to Eureka Bibliotek - the Eureka Library!

For my senior project, I wanted to dive into the world of web development and create a site that is an expression of my journey. The site (eureka.eunieceharris.com) is designed to resemble the Dalarna Media Library (Dalarna HÃ¶gskola). Blocks resemble shelves that contain information about what my goals are, interesting collections I find along the way, exhibitions, collection of words, p5js illustrations, and more.

You'll also notice that the site is written primarily in Swedish. In addition to learning different programming languages, I've been learning the Swedish language as well and wanted to incorporate it into the website as well as corresponding content.
